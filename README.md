This is an implementation of a feature store in order to have a tool to keep track of the features that going to be used in the process of building and training Machine Learning models. This feature store was built on top of [Feast](https://docs.feast.dev/).

Feast is an operational data system for managing and serving machine learning features to models in production. Feast is able to serve feature data to models from a low-latency online store (for real-time prediction) or from an offline store (for scale-out batch scoring or model training).
